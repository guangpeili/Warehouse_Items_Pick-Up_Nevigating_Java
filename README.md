# Warehouse_Items_Pick-Up_Nevigating_Java
* This repository contains a Java program which is able to find the shortest path in a warehouse with multiple items to be picked up
* The file which contains layout of the warehouse, the positions of all items and the details of those items will be given and explained later in this Markdown file

## Main Function
* The user is able to set the start location as well as the dropping location in the warehouse
* The user can choose from two different algorithms (nearest-neighbor and brancn-and-bound) to find the shortest path to gather all items in one order and plot the generated shortest path in a graph. The graph of one particular order is shown down below (red block means starting and dropping location for workers, blue block means the items waited to be picked up is on this shelf, and the yellow trail means the generated shortest path):

* The user can bath process all 2,500 orders given in _warehouse-orders-v02.csv_ and return the result as a text file. The result stored in a txt file is shown below

* The user can reorder all the 2,500 orders by setting a weight limit and number-of-items limit for a single order. Therefore, some orders will be joined together and some else might be splited into two or more orders


## Libraries Used 
1. [**_OpenCSV_**](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net), which is used to read data fro given csv files
2. [**_Commons-lang3_**](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/), which is required for running the **_OpenCSV_** library
3. [**_StdLib_**](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdDraw.java.html), developed by Princeton University, which is used to plot the shortest path generated by the algorithm

## Warehouse Data Files Used
1. _warehouse-orders-v02.csv_: This csv file contains the information of all 2,500 orders, with each order containing multiple items, which are representated by their serial number
2. _item-details.csv_: This csv file contains the information of dimension (length, width, and height) and weight of selected items. Note that we are still missing the details of a large portion of all items
3. _warehouse-grid.csv_: This csv file tells where each item is located in the warehouse

## Source Code Explination
1. _Node.java_: This is the class which represents girds in the warehosue. It can tell whether there is a shelf on that particular node (whether it is blocked). And it also contains the _f_, _g_, _h_ values which are used in the A* search
2. _Matrices.java_: This is used for reducing matrices in branch-and-bound algorithm
3. _CsvWriter.java_: This is for generating the text files
4. _BnbBatch.java_: Batch processing using branch-and-bound
5. _ShortestPathBatch.java_: Batch processing using nearest neighbor
6. _Test.java_: Process one single order and print the path in a graph
7. _Reordering.java_: This is for the reordering of all orders by setting a weight and number limit

## Bugs & Glitches
1. After the number of items in one single order exceeds 15, using branch-and-bound to obtain the shortes path can be extremely time consuming, and in most cases the memory will run out (I'm using a Macbook with 8GB Ram)
2. In item details, we are still missing weight information of a lot of items. So the total weight and total effort may not display normally
