# Warehouse_Items_Pick-Up_Nevigating_Java
* This repository contains a Java program which is able to find the shortest path in a warehouse with multiple items to be picked up
* The file which contains layout of the warehouse, the positions of all items and the details of those items will be given and explained later in this Markdown file

## Libraries Used 
1. [**_OpenCSV_**](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net), which is used to read data fro given csv files
2. [**_Commons-lang3_**](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/), which is required for running the **_OpenCSV_** library
3. [**_StdLib_**](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/StdDraw.java.html), developed by Princeton University, which is used to plot the shortest path generated by the algorithm

## Warehouse Data Files Used
1. _warehouse-orders-v02.csv_: This csv file contains the information of all 2,500 orders, with each order containing multiple items, which are representated by their serial number
2. _item-details.csv_: This csv file contains the information of dimension (length, width, and height) and weight of selected items. Note that we are still missing the details of a large portion of all items
3. _warehouse-grid.csv_: This csv file tells where each item is located in the warehouse
